# **Gym Pose Estimation**
**Problem Statement** : The aim of project is ensuring correct hand posture during pushups, which is crucial for avoiding injury and maximizing the effectiveness of the exercise.

**Approach Overview**: Approach which involves using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for pose estimation.

**Data Collection**: It learns through real time Data when the camera is working.

**Training**: Describe the process of training the KNN classifier using the extracted features and corresponding labels (correct hand posture or incorrect hand posture). Highlight the importance of parameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

**Testing and Evaluation**: Discuss how you evaluated the trained model on new images or video frames to classify the hand posture during pushups. Mention metrics used for evaluation, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

**Results and Performance**: Nearly 96.7 % accuracy made the model  in detecting correct hand posture during pushups. Mainly the angle of the hand made a big problem but after a lot of changes it got resolved.

**Future Improvements**: There are potential future improvements or extensions to the project, such as incorporating real-time pose estimation using webcam feeds, deploying the model in a mobile app, or integrating feedback mechanisms for users.

**Conclusion**: This project is mainly used through real time webcam and this is given me a lot to learn in machine learning, with mediapipe and open cv i got an accuracy of 96.7% using evalution metrics.
